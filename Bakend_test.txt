1. Configure and write swagger documentation for the apis.
2. Role based access for APIs:
	->  Create DB schema to store user roles, one user can have multiple roles. (example roles: ADMIN, USER)
	->  Store the user roles in auth token
	->  write the below apis with role based access
		ADMIN APIS (APIs should only be accessed by users who have role as ADMIN):
			a) GET /admin/users  
				This API should return all the users present in the database.
			b) POST /admin/user/role/add 
					Accept userId, role in the request body and add it to the user.
		USER APIS (Accessible by users and admins):
			a) GET /user return the user details basedon the userId present in the auth token.
			b) for above api add query parameter userId=<value> and this query parameter should be valid only for admin users.
				If authenticated user is admin and query parameter userId=<value> is not None then return the user details of the specified userId. Otherwise return the authenticated user details.
3. Add payload,query params sanitization (Security checks) for all APIs.
4. Write Unit test for the apis.
5. Write query to fetch users count for each role.
